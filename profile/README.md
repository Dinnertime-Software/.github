# `  DINNERTIME SOFTWARE üçù  `

Dinnertime Software is a programming collaboration between [Giacomo Loparco](https://github.com/loparcog/), [Jacob Gordon](https://github.com/Jzar/), and [Bilal Jaffry](https://github.com/jaffry-b). It is a project to work on software we want to see in the world, rather than backing companies actively causing grief to others. In this way, we have no clue what we're making, but hell if we aren't passionate about it.
